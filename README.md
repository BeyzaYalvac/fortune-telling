>A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

>This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

## description:

### This project is my first flutter project. It is an assignment given in my education. We were asked to show the last screen and give the data and create the project. And that's how I made my first flutter project. It pulls data from the list and prints it to the log screen, randomly extracting data from the data according to the key pressed by the user.
